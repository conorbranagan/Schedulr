Schedulr

Schedulr is an easy-to-use tool to create a schedule for a semester in your college/university.

Why would you use this instead of just pen and paper?

With Schedulr you can add a whole list of classes, with many of them conflicting with eachother. From there you can play around
with enabling and disabling classes until you have the schedule you want. Conflicts are detected automatically and you can easily
share your final schedule on facebook or by email, etc.

What about universities that already have scheduling systems in place?

While this may not make sense for everyone, the university scheduling systems I have used have often been old, outdated or
very slow. In many cases, the systems are slow because there's hundreds of students trying to access the system at the same time.
Schedulr provides a system that is almost entirely on the frontend, so reactions from the system are almost automatic.


Project Details:

Schedulr was developed mainly as a way to learn my way around the CakePHP framework. In the end, the app ended up being
more frontend heavy than I had originally imagined. I ended up learning more advanced javascript techniques (i.e., some OOP
stuff I hadn't used before) along with a bit more about jQuery.


Credits, etc.:
- Original idea was from my good friend, Jessica.
- Developed using CakePHP 1.3 and jQuery 1.4
- Uses the jQuery plugin Facebox quite a bit (http://famspam.com/facebox/)
